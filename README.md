# RNAseqPipelineComparison
An R script to plot values (gene expression) from two separate sources (pipelines) and to determine R^2.

This analysis utilized unique genes identified by two separate pipelines (Kallisto and Sailfish) and compared their respective
expression values for each gene. These comparisons were completed with normalized expression values and with log2 values. 
For example, the K2 column corresponds to the log2 expression value identified by the Kallisto pipeline.
